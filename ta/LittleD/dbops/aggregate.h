@brief		The relational aggregate (GROUP BY) operator.
@details	The projecting expressions are those that are parsed from the
		SELECT clause.  Some assumptions are made.  The most important
		of these is that we assume that expressions are never larger
		than DB_INT8_MAX.  We also assume that no expressions can have
		non-grouping or non-aggregated expressions.

@brief		Initialize an aggregate operator.
@param		ap			Pointer to the aggregate operator that
					is to be initialized.
@param		child			Pointer to the operator immediately
					below @p ap in the execution tree. That
					is, the child.
@param		exprs			Array of bytecode projecting
					expressions.
@param		num_expr		The num of elements in @p exprs.
@param		groupby_exprs		The set of expressions that determines
					how the tuples are grouped during
					aggregation.
@param		num_groupby_exprs	The number of elements in
					@p groupby_exprs.
@param		having_expr		The bytecode expression generated
					from the HAVING clause.
@param		mmp			The per-query memory manager being used
					to allocate memory for this query.
@returns	@c 1 if the operator was initialized, @c -1 if an error occured,
		@c 0 otherwise.
