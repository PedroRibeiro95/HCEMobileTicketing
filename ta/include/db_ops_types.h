@brief		Type definitions for relational operators.
@details	This is a utility header file that contains database operator
		related information.  The main goal of this file is to achieve
		an object-oriented style to all operators by simulating
		inheritence and polymorphism with well constructed structs.

		Notes:
		*** _NO_ method prototypes should appear in this file. ***
		-The idea is that the header files for all of the operators
		should be able to reference this file safely, db_ops.h should
		be able to reference this file and operator header files safely
		and all operator implementation files should be able to
		reference db_ops.h safely without creating a circular
		dependency.
