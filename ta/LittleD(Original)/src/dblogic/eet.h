@brief		Structure definitions and method prototypes for handling
		expressions.
@details	Expressions are stored as "Evaluable Expression Trees", which
		are arrays where each term in the expression is stored as a
		node in the array, in post-order fashion (reverse polish
		notation).  A shunting-yard style algorithm is used for
		efficient evaluation.
